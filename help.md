## Available Courses

There are two courses available:

* Advanced Algebra (adv alg)
* Geometry GT (geo gt)

They can be referred to by their full name or the short name in parentheses.

## Interacting on Twitter

If you tweet at the bot @braddock_canvas, you need to include two things:

* Course (see Available Courses)
* Type of Information (choices include: announcement, homework, test)

Example: @braddock_canvas geo gt homework

## Setting Up Discord

After you have invited the bot to your server, you can have it monitor courses and send out messages when an announcement is created or an assignment is created (similar to the Twitter bot).

To do so, a user with administrative privileges must send a message that does the following:

* Tags the bot
* Has a course (see Available Courses)
* Says either "add" or "remove"
* Lists a channel (optional - if none, then the channel where the message was sent)

Example: @Mr. Braddock's Canvas add Advanced Algebra #math-class

## Interacting on Discord

Interacting with the Discord bot works very similarly to interacting with the Twitter bot. You must tag the bot, include a course, and what information you want.

Example: @Mr. Braddock's Canvas adv alg tests
